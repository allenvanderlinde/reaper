Builds useful HTML pages which describe, organize, and provide basic metadata about feed files for SIS integrations.

Introduction
--------
Reaper is a lightweight utility which produces well-formatted, human-readable, HTML-rich pages which describe various information about a SIS (Student Information System) integration feed file. A shining point of reaper is that it can produce specialized metadata of a feed file in a nicely organized way which can be used as a means to quickly "proofread" thousands of lines of integration entries preventing failed executions and suggesting incomplete or missing data.

I'm writing reaper as both a challenge to produce a powerful tool and to provide technical support and staff of educational institutions which utilize SIS integrations a meaningful, visual "draft" of their feed before committing changes in a live or production environment.
